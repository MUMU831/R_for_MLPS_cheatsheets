## Lecture 5: Logistic Regression & Beyond Linearity

Key specific tasks we covered in this lecture:

* logistic regression
* interaction effects and transformed variables in linear models
* basis functions
* polynomial regression
* standard error curves for linear regression fits
* step functions, regression splines and knots
* natural cubic spline
* local regression
* Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
