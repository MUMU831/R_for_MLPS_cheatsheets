## Lecture 4: Linear Regression and Sparsity

Key specific tasks we covered in this lecture are around linear regression and sparsity.

* simple linear regression (unpenalized)
    + RSS
    + estimated parameters
    + SE of estimated parameters
    + confidence intervals
    + t-stat
    + p-value
    + RSE
    + R-squared
    + F-statistic (overall and comparing subset of features)
* heteroskedasticity
* plotting residual plots, outliers, and high-leverage points
* collinearity
* VIF
* sparse linear models w/feature selection
    + forward stepwise
    + backward stepwise
    + hybrid stepwise
    + C_p, AIC, BIC, adjusted R-squared
    + ridge regression
    + lasso regression
* principal components regression (PCR)
* partial least squares
